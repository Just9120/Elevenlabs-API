# Delivery plan: Elevenlabs-API

## Operational dashboard

Status vocabulary:

- `source-done/merged` — repository source/docs merged to `main`.
- `CI-verified` — relevant GitHub Actions checks passed.
- `deployed` — factual web/API component deployment evidence exists for a specific commit and component.
- `migration-applied` — factual operator evidence shows the production database reached a specific Alembic revision.
- `worker-running` — factual operator evidence shows the intended worker process is running.
- `production-live` — factual end-to-end runtime/operator evidence exists for successful production processing; merge, CI, deployment, migration, API health, or idle worker evidence alone does not prove this state.
- `manual-ops-required` — cannot be completed by a coding agent alone.
- `deferred` — intentionally outside current PR scope.
- `blocked` — requires decision, access, migration, or runtime work.

Capability/status snapshot:

- Google Colab is the current working production contour for provider transcription, Google Drive/Docs transcript output, and `manifest` progress/skip mutation.
- Studio PWA is the current development contour intended to duplicate Google Colab product scope with PWA/platform adaptations.
- Studio PWA source has many platform foundations merged: account/session/BYOK, projects, sources, Google Drive OAuth/metadata/folder-child selection, local temporary upload intake, persisted job records, job UI, preflight/claim-readiness guardrails, and the combined normal-workspace `Подготовка` composer.
- Studio PWA production processing is not claimed: current source has a dedicated `studio-worker` polling process entrypoint and Compose source wiring, plus internal processing/provider/output boundary slices through safe output persistence, fenced completion, a synchronous single-job orchestrator, an internal one-shot explicit-job claim-and-orchestrate boundary, an internal single-iteration claim-next boundary, and the atomic `/jobs/batch` normal creation path. This source and partial operator evidence still do not prove production-live processing or manifest mutation.
- Studio job persistence migration rollout remains manual/operator-scoped unless runtime/operator evidence exists; current operator evidence records production database migration `0009_job_output_destinations` as applied.

- ✅ **DOCS-REF-01 — Documentation reconciliation and architecture baseline** — merged/completed docs-only reconciliation; no runtime behavior change.
- ✅ **RT-REF-01 — Refactor realtime frontend boundaries and harden permission-cancellation lifecycle** — merged into main via PR #65; static/generated-JS coverage added; manual permission-cancellation validation remains pending under LIVE-COLAB-PROXY-01.
- ✅ **RT-POLISH-01 — Behavior-preserving realtime frontend lifecycle readability refactor** — merged into main; no new manual/browser evidence claimed.
- ✅ **RT-TOKEN-01 — Fresh realtime single-use token per standalone Start attempt** — done/merged into main; sequential Start → Stop → Start in one standalone page was manually confirmed after RT-TOKEN-01.
- ✅ **OPENAI-BATCH-DURATION-01 — OpenAI batch duration-aware splitting** — manually runtime-confirmed for one long duration-triggered OpenAI batch run that produced a Google Doc; oversized-file and OpenAI diarization runtime validation remain pending.
- ✅ **OPENAI-BATCH-TIMING-01 — Safe OpenAI per-chunk timing observability** — implemented as local diagnostics; manual review remains separate.
- ✅ **USER-SEGMENTS-VISUAL-BUILDER-01 — Visual multi-document segmentation builder** — completed/merged via PR #75; raw manual segment text input replaced with a one-source-only visual builder before provider transcription.
- ✅ **USER-SEGMENTS-HARDENING-01 — Harden visual segment builder validation** — completed follow-up; full-chain add validation, correct-card add errors, and regression coverage added.
- ✅ **PWA-FOUNDATION-01 — Studio PWA foundation and isolated delivery boundary** — completed/merged via PR #77; existing Python CI and Studio PWA CI passed before merge.
- ✅ **PWA-DEPLOY-01 — Manual first Studio deployment** — completed for the existing stateless `studio-web` container at `https://studio.librechat.online`; initial automatic CD was not part of that first manual deployment and only public app-shell availability is validated.
- ✅ **PWA-PLATFORM-01-PREP — Studio platform implementation contract and private-path cleanup** — completed/merged documentation and decision preparation; no runtime implementation.
- ✅ **PWA-PLATFORM-01 — First Studio stateful account/session/BYOK platform core** — implemented in source form; manual production rollout remains operator-scoped.
- ✅ **PWA-PROJECTS-01 — Studio Projects API foundation** — source-done/merged: backend persistence/API/migration foundation and platform-mode frontend integration are present in repository source; production-live status requires operator evidence.
- ✅ **PWA-SOURCES-01A — Studio source/storage backend foundation** — backend foundation is live/done: source records, Google Drive source metadata, selected output folder binding, local-upload initiation, S3/R2 presigned upload contract, 1-hour expiry, and cleanup CLI.
- ✅ **PWA-SOURCES-01B — Studio source upload storage runtime config** — done/live: temporary local-upload S3/R2 env and file-mounted secrets have been wired into the production `studio-api` Compose runtime by the operator.
- ✅ **PWA-SOURCES-02 — Studio project source UI** — implemented on main: platform-mode UI binds output Drive folder metadata, lists/deletes source records, adds Google Drive source metadata, and uses direct browser PUT local-upload flow.
- ✅ **PWA-GOOGLE-01A — Studio Google Drive OAuth backend foundation** — backend-only explicit-consent Google Drive connection foundation is merged and manually rolled out. No frontend UI, Drive picker, Drive file listing/access, Google Docs output, provider execution, transcription jobs, queues/workers, or manifest mutation.
- ✅ **PWA-GOOGLE-01B — Studio Google OAuth runtime config** — merged/source-done Compose runtime wiring for Google OAuth env and file-mounted client-secret configuration; production rollout/live enablement is not claimed without operator evidence.

- ✅ **PWA-JOBS-02-PREP — Studio job processing execution contract** — source-done/merged via PR #104: documented future worker/provider execution boundary before coding slices implement processing. Production migration rollout remains manual/operator-scoped.
- ✅ **PWA-JOBS-02A — Studio job lifecycle guardrails for existing record-only APIs** — source-done/merged on main via PR #105; no worker/provider execution, queues, Google Docs output, output persistence, manifest mutation, migrations, CI/CD, Docker/runtime/deploy, production rollout, or secrets.
- ✅ **PWA-JOBS-02B — Studio job processing preflight snapshot for existing record-only jobs** — source-done/merged on main via PR #106; no worker/provider execution, queue consumer, credential use, Drive download/export, source byte access, Google Docs output, output persistence, manifest mutation, job claiming/leases, migrations, CI/CD, Docker/runtime/deploy, production rollout, or secrets handling changes.

- ✅ **PWA-PROCESSING-PREFLIGHT-01A — Read-only Studio production host preflight workflow** — source-done/merged via PR #132; it did not execute production preflight and does not claim production processing smoke success.
- ✅ **PWA-GOOGLE-PICKER-01 — Native Google Drive Picker navigation for Studio PWA** — source-done/merged into main via PR #133 (`096a6a40ad96789af990d4fbf05087d2f1c74bd3`): replaced manual Drive file/folder ID UX with official Google Picker modal, server-side verified source persistence, and server-side verified output-folder selection while preserving `drive.file` only.
- ✅ **PWA-GOOGLE-PICKER-POLISH-01 — Improve Google Picker navigation and presentation** — source-done/merged into main via PR #134 (head `cad5df98392b6761354f6988476d019fe50990b4`, merge `9849c7f045b9883baacb6e9de8d0ec2e9e8f3332`): polished the official Picker with list mode, Russian locale, mode-specific titles, viewport-aware sizing, explicit origin, and selection limits without backend, OAuth, deployment, or production processing changes.
- ✅ **PWA-GOOGLE-PICKER-ROOT-01 — Start Google Picker navigation at My Drive root** — source-done/merged into main via PR #135 (head `09828da42abdaa87488bd8260631c56ecae04672`, merge `79d11be53308614a4ee69b5c76554f59795a3ee2`): configured both official Picker modes with `DocsView.setParent("root")` after manual post-deployment production observation found the output-folder view still showed folders from across Drive as one flat global list. Root-based Picker production navigation is not claimed without separate operator evidence.
- ✅ **PWA-AUTH-OAUTH-UX-01 — Smooth session bootstrap and return from Google OAuth** — source-done/merged via PR #136 (head `e8ecf2fea7548c4f13914f94d1096763e27714d6`, merge `6745d45834c98c037b7000ebd5ccf6c921b4a8ef`); CI #327 and Studio PWA CI #152 passed.
- ✅ **PWA-UX-UI-01 — Consolidate Studio workspace UX and restore source-file selection** — source-done/merged via PR #137 (head `ea44439625c36e8dc2cd0c6b5bd9c7c2435486b4`, merge `a0d4d7a3752b01de88349c0172655c9e642bda1b`); CI #330 passed and Studio PWA CI #155 passed. Manual production screenshots confirm the new platform navigation, project workspace tabs, and consolidated Settings UI are visible; the same screenshots exposed visual polish defects now addressed by PWA-UX-UI-POLISH-01. Source Picker media-file visibility is not claimed as manually validated without separate operator evidence.
- ✅ **PWA-UX-UI-POLISH-01 — Polish the Studio workspace layout and high-friction forms** — source-done/merged via PR #141 (head `9ba44863e9c9de7a92b93bceeb64fd7137c20557`, merge `dc876714c1dd85efe16a1fc277abd30464e1e798`); CI #335 passed and Studio PWA CI #160 passed. Manual production evidence confirms the PR #141 UI polish is deployed and visible, source Picker navigation works, `.flac` files are displayed, a source file can be selected, and source Picker media visibility is manually validated. Destination-folder Picker remains blocked in production: it navigates into folders, but inside an empty destination folder the `Выбрать` action remains disabled and destination-folder persistence has not been manually validated.
- ✅ **PWA-GOOGLE-PICKER-FOLDER-SELECT-01 — Restore destination-folder selection** — source-done/merged via PR #142 (head `140c4a769c7c31ad4dd0d5bcc86fb5e3a822f9dd`, merge `acb416dd31ed609cbdf79eaa5b20c529023bed82`); CI #337 passed and Studio PWA CI #162 passed. Manual production evidence confirms destination-folder selection works, selected destination folder persistence works, source Picker displays media files, a `.flac` source can be persisted, and previous source/folder Picker blockers are cleared.
- ✅ **PWA-DRIVE-LINKS-UX-01 — Approved Google Drive resource links** — source-done/merged via PR #143 (head `2421f6e3d306bb770bd6d0a81e229d23fa2c2df8`, merge `62137df92a626048970d3c0f29ffeff69c6fb8a4`); CI #339 passed and Studio PWA CI #164 passed. Manual production evidence confirms the compact Drive-link UI is deployed and visible.
- ✅ **PWA-BATCH-COMPOSER-01 — Combine preparation UX and create source-to-folder rows** — source-done/merged through PR #146 (head `1187548bfc8f66e6f65648bb6a4cd6d5750155e6`, merge `16ecbf2a6f23180bacdf412fa94901069806aea0`); Backend CI #351 passed and Studio PWA CI #176 passed. The merged normal platform project workspace uses `Обзор` plus combined `Подготовка`; source intake and job history live with ordered source→output-folder composer rows, and normal creation submits atomically through `/jobs/batch`. Runtime smoke, production-live processing, provider calls, Google Docs creation, rollback, cleanup, and manifest parity remain separate.
- 📝 **PWA-AUTH-OAUTH-UX-01 note** — superseded line retained below for context: current focused frontend/backend UX item: fix two manually observed production defects where the Login form flashes while `/api/auth/session` is still being checked and Google OAuth callback leaves the browser on an API status/JSON page instead of returning to the PWA.
- 👉 **PWA-BATCH-COMPOSER-ROW-UX-01 — Inline source and destination selection inside repeatable composer rows** — active in-PR item in PR #148; changes `Подготовка` to row-first source→folder selection, Google Drive/local multi-select row expansion, and secondary project-file management while preserving explicit atomic `/jobs/batch` submission.
- ⏸️ **PWA-PROCESSING-ROLLOUT-01A — Manual Studio processing rollout and controlled smoke validation** — paused behind PR #148: previous operator rollout validation recorded migration-applied/API-health/worker-idle evidence, and browser acceptance after PR #146 exposed the split intake/composer UX defect now fixed in PR #148. Controlled production processing smoke remains separate and not run; no production-live processing claim is made.
- 📋 **RUNTIME-01 — Batch source picker / manifest skip / Google Docs output smoke-check** — deferred by current product priority; still planned manual Colab/Drive/Docs validation without claiming pass/fail.

## Last completed item: PWA-BATCH-COMPOSER-01 — Combine preparation UX and create source-to-folder rows

Status: source-done/merged through PR #146. The normal project workspace exposes only `Обзор` and `Подготовка`; browser acceptance after PR #146 confirmed that deployment was visible, then exposed that `Подготовка` still split standalone source intake from later composer selection. PWA-BATCH-COMPOSER-ROW-UX-01 is therefore active in PR #148 and must complete before rollout/smoke resumes.

Latest recorded operator rollout evidence:

- Confirmed before PR #146: the compact Drive-link UI is deployed and visible.
- Confirmed before PR #146: destination folder selection works.
- Confirmed before PR #146: selected destination folder persistence works.
- Confirmed before PR #146: source Picker displays media files and one source can be persisted.
- Recorded in the previous operator rollout validation: production database migration `0009_job_output_destinations` was applied.
- Recorded in the previous operator rollout validation: Studio API health reported the database reachable and migrations current.
- Recorded in the previous operator rollout validation: exactly one `studio-worker` was manually started; at that validation time the worker image matched the active API image, no HTTP ports were published, the worker remained running with restart count zero, the worker was observed idle, and no queued or processing jobs existed during idle validation. This worker state and image identity have not been revalidated after PR #146 merge commit `16ecbf2a6f23180bacdf412fa94901069806aea0`, so this evidence must not imply the worker is necessarily still running now.
- Confirmed after PR #146 merge commit `16ecbf2a6f23180bacdf412fa94901069806aea0`: browser acceptance showed the selected project exposes exactly `Обзор` and `Подготовка`, and the PR #146 composer frontend was deployed and visible.
- Exposed after PR #146: browser acceptance found the split source-intake/composer UX defect in `Подготовка`; PR #148 / PWA-BATCH-COMPOSER-ROW-UX-01 is the active in-PR correction.
- Not run: the controlled production processing smoke has not been run, and no `production-live` Studio processing claim is allowed yet.

Rollout boundary:

- Worker startup has operator evidence as `worker-running`, but this is not a production-live processing claim.
- Controlled production processing smoke remains separate and not run.
- Provider requests remain separate.
- Google document creation remains separate.
- Exactly-once output validation remains separate.
- Cleanup and rollback remain separate.
- Manifest parity remains separate.
- No production-live processing claim is made.

## Current checkpoint

Batch Colab remains the primary working product contour and current/fallback production workflow for provider transcription, Google Drive/Docs output, Drive integration, and `manifest` progress/skip mutation. Docs-only maintenance workflows remain separate and must not call provider/STT/LLM APIs. Realtime Colab/proxy remains an experimental contour for browser capture + ElevenLabs realtime STT and must not save Google Docs, mutate `manifest`, or integrate speaker projects.

Studio PWA is the current development contour intended to duplicate Google Colab product scope with PWA/platform adaptations. Source on main now includes account/session/BYOK, projects, sources, Google Drive OAuth/metadata/folder-child selection, local temporary upload intake, persisted job records, job UI, preflight/claim-readiness guardrails, internal processing-time source materialization, processing prerequisites, and the PR #146 combined `Подготовка` composer with ordered source→output-folder rows and atomic `/jobs/batch` submission. Browser evidence after PR #146 confirms the deployed project workspace was visible with `Обзор` and `Подготовка`, and also exposed the split intake/composer UX defect now tracked as active PR #148 / PWA-BATCH-COMPOSER-ROW-UX-01. PWA-WORKER-01A is source-done/merged via PR #124 (head `6e858a066304b3bf20388322c81c293f61df49ff`, merge `99f0e34e67740a60053242e98e194f888ff05341`) with Backend CI #293 passed and Studio PWA CI #125 passed. PWA-WORKER-01-PREP is source-done/merged via PR #125 (head `a5694a13db1243b12bd93705b280057cbc35bbfc`, merge `e850f6f6cd68dde8ebb55c8008bcc19f1c9750c4`) with Backend CI #296 passed. PWA-WORKER-01B is source-done/merged via PR #126 (head `b0236d1f6eab4495d2b1d315f4dc06f6c38055a5`, merge `4b91598651c90199ffb189b3758f9bfab6a05d11`) with Backend CI #299 passed and Studio PWA CI #128 passed. Current Studio source now includes a worker entrypoint and Compose service definition, but no production rollout, public processing pipeline, production processing pipeline, frontend output rendering source now exists for an explicitly opened job, but this does not mean production deployment, production-live processing, manifest mutation, or exactly-once Google document creation is claimed. PWA-OUTPUT-02-PREP is source-done/merged via PR #127 (head `709ee29b2323c91a34683ce4d2b70804c7a6c4bc`, merge `fc856758da6e08d2fbdb42ece5004d6a9117cd15`) with Backend CI #301 passed. PWA-OUTPUT-02A is source-done/merged via PR #128 (head `3b713f2f0defee1a9ff08c5177f29277637e5b2b`, merge `80e29cab9db33a497fe2d3c71d31c34f7bd8de0c`) with Backend CI #304 passed and Studio PWA CI #131 passed. PWA-OUTPUT-02B is source-done/merged via PR #129 (head `a3ea0117b525970cdeec8235c3d740b1160387cb`, merge `7d555faa3e6e02d41327d6761f6bda1c2c7d59dd`) with Backend CI #307 passed and Studio PWA CI #134 passed. PWA-PROCESSING-ROLLOUT-01-PREP is source-done/merged via PR #130 (head `ba87fe7a991b748b8f1fbc0eed3e5b2d295622c0`, merge `41dfa926f77b2a8657dec1d675d770000b188843`) with Backend CI #310 passed and Studio PWA CI #137 passed. PWA-PROCESSING-ROLLOUT-01A has partial operator rollout evidence: production database migration `0009_job_output_destinations` was applied, API health reported database reachable and migrations current, and exactly one worker was observed running and idle at the previous validation point. Controlled processing smoke remains paused behind PR #148 and not run, and no production-live Studio processing claim is made. STUDIO-CD-IMAGE-01 and STUDIO-CD-STDIN-01 are source-done, CI-verified, and production-live from operator evidence. Studio job persistence migration rollout has operator evidence for `0009_job_output_destinations` as migration-applied, and API health reported database reachable/migrations current during the previous validation. Exactly one worker was observed as worker-running/idle with restart count zero and no published HTTP ports at that validation point, but that worker state and image identity have not been revalidated after PR #146 merge commit `16ecbf2a6f23180bacdf412fa94901069806aea0`. Controlled production smoke remains paused behind PR #148 and not run; no production-live Studio processing is claimed.

Current confirmed realtime evidence is partial: one display+microphone run confirmed standalone page boot, capture, WebSocket open, `session_started`, partial transcript, committed transcript, user Stop, media-track release and WebSocket close. After RT-TOKEN-01, the standalone page also manually confirmed sequential Start → Stop → Start without page reload: both sessions reached WebSocket open and `session_started`, both stopped cleanly, and the final close was user-initiated with code 1000. Full realtime E2E success is not claimed.

## Active recommended next item

**PWA-BATCH-COMPOSER-ROW-UX-01 — Inline source and destination selection inside repeatable composer rows** is the active in-PR item in PR #148. **PWA-PROCESSING-ROLLOUT-01A — Manual Studio processing rollout and controlled smoke validation** remains the canonical operator rollout item, but is paused until PR #148 is complete and browser acceptance confirms the row-first `Подготовка` UX. The next recommended sequence after PR #148 is:

1. Establish factual web deployment evidence for the eventual PR #148 merge commit.
2. If automatic Studio Platform CD did not deploy that frontend commit, manually dispatch only the `web` component.
3. Require the normal Studio web deploy success boundary: `STUDIO_PLATFORM_WEB_DEPLOY_OK`.
4. Perform browser acceptance confirming the selected project exposes exactly `Обзор` and `Подготовка`.
5. Confirm `Подготовка` contains source intake, ordered source→folder composer rows, and current/recent job history.
6. Only after browser acceptance, run exactly one bounded controlled smoke using one operator-approved test account/project, one small supported source, one active owner-scoped ElevenLabs credential, one authenticated Google connection, one writable selected output folder, one composer row, one resulting job, and no automatic retry.

Latest recorded operator rollout evidence is limited to migration-applied for production database revision `0009_job_output_destinations`, API health reporting database reachable/migrations current, and exactly one manually started `studio-worker` observed running/idle with no published HTTP ports and restart count zero at the previous validation time. The worker state and image identity were observed only at that validation time and have not been revalidated after PR #146 merge commit `16ecbf2a6f23180bacdf412fa94901069806aea0`; do not infer the worker is necessarily still running now. Composer web deployment, browser acceptance, and controlled processing smoke remain unverified, and controlled smoke remains not-run. This docs PR itself does not deploy, start or stop workers, create jobs, call providers, call Google APIs, perform production smoke, perform cleanup, perform rollback, requeue/reset jobs, delete or recreate Google documents, run another migration, downgrade the database, remove volumes, or perform destructive Docker Compose operations.

**RUNTIME-01** remains deferred.

## Near backlog

### PWA-GOOGLE-04B — Studio Google Drive folder children source selection UI

Active frontend/docs item: platform-mode Studio can list direct children of one explicitly supplied Google Drive folder ID through `GET /api/google/drive/folders/{folder_id}/children`, render only safe normalized metadata, mark folder items as non-source-file entries, select file-like child items, and create Google Drive source records through `POST /api/projects/{project_id}/sources/google-drive` using selected safe child metadata. Pagination uses `next_page_token` in component state only and appends additional safe items. Explicit non-goals: no Drive Picker, no recursive folder browsing, no Drive search, no Google Docs creation, no provider execution, no jobs/queues/workers, no migration, no production deployment, and no manifest mutation.

### PWA-GOOGLE-04A — Studio Google Drive folder children backend foundation

Source-done/merged on main: authenticated Studio users can list safe normalized metadata for direct children of one explicitly supplied Google Drive folder ID through `GET /api/google/drive/folders/{folder_id}/children` using the current user's active Google OAuth connection. The endpoint returns only `folder_id`, safe child `items` metadata consistent with the single-file metadata endpoint, and optional `next_page_token`. Explicit non-goals: no Drive Picker, no Drive listing/browsing UI, no recursive folder browsing, no Drive search, no Google Docs creation, no provider execution, no jobs/queues/workers, no migration, no production deployment, and no manifest mutation.

### PWA-GOOGLE-03B — Studio Drive metadata verification frontend

Source-done/merged on main: platform-mode Studio can verify one explicitly supplied Google Drive file/folder ID through `GET /api/google/drive/files/{drive_file_id}/metadata`, preview only safe normalized metadata, and create a Google Drive source record through `POST /api/projects/{project_id}/sources/google-drive` using the verified id, name, MIME type, size, and web view link. Static mode remains demo-only and must make zero `/api` requests. Explicit non-goals: no Drive picker, no Drive listing/browsing UI, no Google Docs creation, no provider execution, no jobs/queues/workers, no migration, no production deployment, and no manifest mutation.

### PWA-GOOGLE-03A — Studio Google Drive metadata backend foundation

Source-done/merged on main: authenticated Studio users can request safe metadata for one explicitly supplied Google Drive file/folder ID via the current user's active Google OAuth connection. The endpoint must not expose refresh tokens, access tokens, raw Google payloads, client secrets, secret file paths, owners, permissions, labels, thumbnails, or sharing details. It has no Drive picker, no Drive listing/browsing UI, no Google Docs creation, no provider execution, no jobs/queues/workers, no migration, no production deployment, and no manifest mutation.

### PWA-GOOGLE-02 — Studio Google Drive connection UI

Source-done/merged: platform-mode account settings can show Google Drive connection loading/connected/disconnected/revoked/unavailable states, start OAuth via `POST /api/google/oauth/start` with CSRF and immediate browser navigation, and disconnect via `DELETE /api/google/connection` with CSRF. The UI may render only safe connection metadata (`connected`, `status`, Google email, scopes, connected/revoked timestamps) and must not store OAuth URLs, states, codes, tokens, provider credentials, or secrets in browser storage. This item has no Drive picker, Drive source browsing, Google Docs creation, provider execution, jobs/queues/workers, migration, production deploy, manifest mutation, or backend OAuth behavior change.

### PWA-GOOGLE-01B — Studio Google OAuth runtime config

Done/source-merged ops/config item: Compose runtime wiring for `STUDIO_GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `STUDIO_GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET_FILE`, `STUDIO_GOOGLE_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI`, `STUDIO_GOOGLE_OAUTH_SCOPES`, and `STUDIO_GOOGLE_OAUTH_STATE_TTL_SECONDS` exists in source. The client secret remains file-based and mounted read-only into `studio-api`; incomplete config must continue to fail closed. Production rollout/live enablement is not claimed without operator evidence. This item does not implement Drive picker, Drive file listing/access, Google Docs output, provider execution, transcription jobs, queues/workers, migrations, production deployment, or manifest mutation.

### PWA-GOOGLE-01A — Studio Google Drive OAuth backend foundation

Done/live backend-only item: authenticated Studio users can establish an explicit-consent Google Drive OAuth connection through backend status/start/callback/disconnect endpoints. Refresh tokens are encrypted at rest with the existing credential master-key pattern and are never returned to the browser. Short-lived OAuth state is stored hashed and cannot be reused after expiry or successful callback. This item does not implement frontend UI, Drive picker, Drive file listing/access, Google Docs output, provider execution, transcription jobs, queues/workers, or manifest mutation.

### PWA-SOURCES-02 — Studio project source UI

Active frontend/docs item: platform-mode Studio can bind a project to selected output Google Drive folder metadata, list/delete project source records, add Google Drive source-file metadata manually, and upload a local audio/video file with the existing backend contract (`initiate` → browser direct PUT to S3/R2 presigned URL → `complete`). Static mode remains demo-only and must make zero `/api` requests. This item has no backend migration, no backend API change unless a frontend-blocking contract bug is found, no provider execution, no Google OAuth/Drive picker, no Google Docs creation, and no queue/worker.

### PWA-SOURCES-01B — Studio source upload storage runtime config

Done/live: the already-implemented temporary source-upload S3/R2 non-secret settings and file-mounted access-key secrets have been wired into the production `studio-api` Compose runtime by the operator. Secret values remain file-based only; no raw S3/R2 credential values are committed or passed through Compose environment variables. UI, Google OAuth/Drive picker, provider transcription execution, queues/workers, and Google Docs creation remain follow-ups.

### PWA-SOURCES-01A — Studio source/storage backend foundation

PWA-SOURCES-01A is live/done as the backend-only foundation for Studio project sources: projects can store the selected output Google Drive folder, and source records support `google_drive` metadata or `local_upload` temporary S3/R2-compatible storage with fail-closed configuration, presigned upload initiation, 1-hour expiry, and cleanup CLI support. Transcription outputs always target the selected Google Drive folder. Local computer sources are temporary inputs only: they use private object storage, are not proxied through FastAPI memory or stored in PostgreSQL/VPS disk, and expire/delete after 1 hour or after processing in later work. Frontend UI, Google OAuth/Drive picker, provider transcription execution, queues/workers, and Google Docs creation remain follow-ups.

### PWA-PROJECTS-01 — Studio Projects API foundation

Backend foundation for persisted Projects is live: id, owner user id, title, optional description, created_at, updated_at, nullable archived_at, and authenticated owner-scoped API endpoints. The platform-mode Projects UI is available against `/api/projects` while static mode remains demo-only. Uploads, transcription jobs, provider calls, queues/workers, Google OAuth/Drive/Docs, output persistence, public registration, invites, password recovery, and project sharing remain deferred beyond PWA-SOURCES-01A. CD workflow behavior is unchanged.

### PWA-PLATFORM-01 — First Studio stateful platform core

Planned first stateful stage: account/session/BYOK foundation with bootstrap-admin or invite-only access, local sessions, encrypted user-owned provider credential lifecycle, and audit/security event boundaries. It is blocked until explicit approval resolves the open decisions listed in `docs/studio-platform-01-prep.md`, including backend framework, database, encryption-key management, backup/restore objective, rate-limit implementation, migration/rollback procedure, stateful deployment design, and whether queue/worker, media storage, and OAuth remain deferred. Provider execution, uploads, Drive/Docs, and workers must remain separate later-stage work unless explicitly approved.

### RUNTIME-01 — batch runtime smoke validation

Validate in real Colab/Drive/Docs:

- launch `notebooks/elevenlabs_api_colab.ipynb` from `main` or selected commit SHA;
- verify relevant Colab Secrets without printing values;
- select source through Drive picker button path;
- create Google Docs transcript in selected output folder;
- verify `manifest` source/document update;
- rerun same source and confirm safe skip / `Пропустить` without repeat provider/STT call;
- record result in `VALIDATION_MATRIX.md` only after factual validation.

### LIVE-COLAB-PROXY-01 remaining validation

Use `docs/realtime-colab.md` as the operator guide. Pending: microphone-only, display-only, loopback/virtual input, explicit Stop-during-prompt cancellation, refreshed-device UX, structured `realtime_live_transcript_v1` copy/download/clear behavior and cross-browser validation. Ordinary browser deny/cancel before WebSocket creation has partial manual evidence only.

### SPEAKER-RUNTIME-01 — speaker project validation

Validate on copied diarized Google Doc only: gate behavior, turn-boundary `Speaker N labels` detection, counts/sample display without persistence, manual mapping, explicit apply, unmapped labels unchanged, and plain-text rewrite/formatting impact.

### PERF-RUNTIME-01 — startup timing collection

Collect timing from clean Colab runtime and confirm summary contains no secrets, transcript body, Docs body content or raw provider responses. Do not treat timing as transcription success.

## Blockers and validation notes

- PWA-DEPLOY-01 public app-shell deployment validation is complete, but it does not validate offline transcription, provider execution, Google integration, authentication, credentials, uploads, jobs, or production processing.
- PWA-PLATFORM-01 remains blocked on explicit approval and unresolved technology/operations decisions listed in `docs/studio-platform-01-prep.md`; backend implementation is not the active immediate item.
- Realtime output-cell UI path is blocked in the tested Colab runtime; active validation path is proxy/new-tab standalone page.
- Realtime evidence is partial and must not be generalized beyond the confirmed display+microphone and sequential same-page Start → Stop → Start paths.
- Batch Google Docs output and manifest skip still need controlled live runtime validation before E2E claims.
- OpenAI duration-triggered chunking has one manually confirmed long-file Google Docs output path; oversized-file and OpenAI diarization validation remain pending.
- OpenAI diarization + chunking remains high risk due to potential inconsistent `Speaker N labels` across chunks.
- Speaker project apply may rewrite Google Doc as plain text; first validation must use copies.

## Docs-only PR validation

For documentation-only PRs, run:

```bash
python scripts/ci_checks.py
pytest -q
git diff --check
```

If runtime code/notebooks/token flow/Google Docs behavior/manifest behavior are untouched, state that explicitly in the PR and final response. Local checks do not replace manual Colab runtime validation.

## PWA-PLATFORM-01 delivery note

- ✅ **PWA-PLATFORM-01 — Studio account/session/BYOK platform core** — implemented in this PR as source, tests, migrations, platform Compose, scripts, and runbooks. It is not yet manually deployed or production-runtime validated.
- 👉 **Next operational action** — operator provisions secrets, starts PostgreSQL/Redis/API, runs explicit pre-migration backup and migration, creates bootstrap admin, rolls out nginx `/api/`, installs the 10-hour backup timer, performs backup/restore rehearsal, and records browser/runtime acceptance evidence.
- 📋 **RUNTIME-01** remains deferred; Colab/provider/Google runtime validation is unchanged by this platform-core PR.

### PWA-PLATFORM-01 hardening follow-up note

The open PR branch now separates static-only and platform-mode Studio builds, keeps PostgreSQL password material file-mounted instead of environment-interpolated, adds authenticated CSRF refresh for page reloads, hardens readiness and trusted-proxy IP handling, and corrects PostgreSQL-only backup retention grouping. Manual deployment/runtime/backup/browser validation remains pending.

### Studio platform isolated CD follow-up note

The current PR replaces the unsafe legacy-only automatic CD contour with isolated platform web/API CD definitions for `deploy/studio/compose.platform.yml`. Automatic deployment remains gated behind `STUDIO_PLATFORM_CD_ENABLED=true`; initial platform web deployment and all migrations, backups/restores, PostgreSQL, Redis, nginx, volume, runtime-secret, and legacy-stack maintenance remain manual/operator-scoped. No production deployment has been executed by coding-agent validation.


## Current delivery update — PWA-JOB-DESTINATION-01
